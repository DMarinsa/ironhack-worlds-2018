## My biggest Trouble.

  Main issue were physics, too much trouble adding angular response to the ball collision whithout using any  library.

## Biggest Challenge to solve yet?

  Adjusting those collisions to the pixel.

## What would I do different if I started all over again?

  -Refactor the collisions.
  -I would totally change the visual aspect :)

## A technical detail.

  Game.js:126.
